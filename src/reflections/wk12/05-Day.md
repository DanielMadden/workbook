# 5: Hackathon Invasion

During my class' first hackathon, I was sick and was remote; I missed out on a great experience. Today I decided to invade the junior's hackathon, have a good time, and bond with the juniors. Their class ended up with much more people that are around my age and phase in life, so I wanted to get to know them for potential friendships. 

I came in my pajamas, and stayed until 1am. The day started out with great conversations with my classmates. Lots of laughs but also a lot of philosophical discussion. I also gleaned wisdom from Zach when I went in to inquire about taxes. I tried to get some work done but it was hard because everyone in my class was relaxing and having fun. I was worried for two classmates since they were still working on their final, but they pulled through! I'm glad that all of their hard work was not put to waste. 

Eventually, an unproductive day led to even more casual time after all of my classmates left. We ended up playing smash bros and eating pizza. I popped in and out of the groups working on their projects, and as the day waned on people started leaving. I had some great conversations with the students who were more my age, and around midnight we all played Halo together.

I had an amazing day, and I feel like I got to experience what I had missed out on when I was sick and working remote. Although I didn't get much work done, it was worth it.
