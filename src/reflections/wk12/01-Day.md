# 1: Final

I grinded the backend out quite easily on Friday and Saturday. I wanted to make sure that it was out of the way as soon as possible. Had a small roadblock in linking it to the front-end due to CORS policy, but Mick was able to point out the potential issue; I missed a single line where I use the CORS policy that had been defined (a minor irritation, but that is usually how coding goes).

To be honest, Sunday and today were wastes of my time. For some reason my discipline plummeted. It's hard to stay focused at home. I made zero progress since Saturday (maybe a bit of an overexaggeration). Tomorrow is going to be different.
