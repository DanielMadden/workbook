# 4: Testing in Vue

## Prompts

### *What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?*
<br/>

```
Unit Testing
Component Testing
End-To-End Testing
```
<br/><hr/><br/>

### *What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?*
<br/>

```
I believe the most useful but most tedious would be End-To-End testing, mainly because it focuses on the main goal: client experience.

But the most important would be unit testing (described below)
```

### *What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?*
<br/>

```
I don't believe one is less useful than the other.
 
Unit testing is important because it makes sure the nitty gritties work; that all the logic works; that everything behind the scenes work. 
Component testing is important because without the components, there is no user experience. 
End to end testing is important because it focuses on the client experience.

End to end experience can't exist without components, and both can't exist without the logical units that comprise the project.
