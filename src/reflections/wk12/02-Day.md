# 2: Final

Very, very pleased with my progress. I decided to come back to Codeworks due to my previous experience with working at home. The frustration I felt yesterday continued into today and fueled me to ignore all distractions and get my work done. Finished the skeleton of the front-end. Now all that's left is styling.
