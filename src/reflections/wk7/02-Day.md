### *What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?*
<br/>

Code documentation is an explanation of the purpose, syntax, and setup of code. You can write how-to's, a README for the repo, or code documentation in the source. You can also throw comments everywhere lol
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What are some of the benefits of Code Documentation?*
<br/>

Code documentation allows for easy pass-offs with the code that will catch any new coders up to speed. It also helps US know what we did since it is very easy to forget. And our IntelliSense will kick in
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *How important is Code documentation and why?*
<br/>

I kind of answered this in the previous question... code documentation allows us to clearly state the expected inputs and outputs of a function. This is important in order for others (or our future selves) to understand the code.
