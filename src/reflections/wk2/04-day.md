## Prompts 

### *What are the benefits of making a plan before writing the code?*
<br/>

It gives us a vision; a picture; a framework of our idea. It gives us a direction. Without that, efficiency is extremely slow as we try to figure it out as we go. 
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *How do you find answers when you're stuck?*
<br/>

The greatest skill I developed when I programmed as a kid was LOOKING EVERYTHING UP ONLINE. W3schools was my most visited website (and it is again). As soon as I run into something I don't know how to do, I alt-tab, ctrl-t, search my problem, find w3schools or stackoverflow, click it, scan it, and alt-tab back.

### *From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways*
<br/>

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.
