<h2>Prompts</h2>

### *"What is the purpose of wire framing?"*
<br/>
Wire framing helps in expressing the design and flow of an idea or plan. 
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *"What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?"*
<br/>
Not sure what this question is asking.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *"Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?"*
<br/>

Yes and no.

If a person can fully understand his concept, have it fully planned out in their mind, and is working alone, then wire-frames are not worth the time, energy, and effort.

However, if ANY of these criteria cannot be met, wire-frames offer many benefits--especially in group projects. They allow us to express our thoughts and ideas. This is extremely important when working with a partner or group because it CLEARLY defines the desired plan and design.

<h2>Reflection</h2> 

I LOVE Tim's teaching style. He's a vibe. Super chill dude.

I was enjoying the FIGMA portion of the teaching. It was something new and seems to be a great tool that I can utilize in the future. Especially because I am obsessed with aesthetics and sleek designs. I'll have a lot of fun with this.

Things have come to a slow though. I'm pretty bored right now. He's now building the website. I already built this website yesterday. I guess they assumed we wouldn't be able to do it? 

I'm trying to refrain from answering any questions he asks. I don't want to seem like the smartass. Those types of people really annoy me. There's one guy in here that has that smartass presence, and it's irritating.

Like, I *know* my stuff. And that guy in the back row who's been programming for more than 10 years *knows* his stuff. But we don't hold high airs and strut about. I try to help my classmates, but only when they ask. 

Anyways. Just ranting. I probably shouldn't be treating this like a journal. But I could care less.

<h2>Challenge</h2>

Of all the people I got paired up with, it was him. I should have made him code. Then he would have been choking left and right. Whatever.
