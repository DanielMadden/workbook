# 1: Developer Portfolio

## Prompts

### *What function does a developer portfolio provide?*
<br/>

```
- Increased visibility and authority.
- A way to prove you know your craft.
- A background of work allowing you to get that first position in the industry.
- It can show your expertise on a subject.
- Increasing your personal brand.
- Stand out from a crowd of candidates in interviews.
```

### *What makes a developer portfolio effective?*
<br/>

```
An effective developer portfolio will showcase the best projects that strongly display the developer's main skillset. 
```

### *What projects do you have that you would include in your portfolio? Why?*
<br/>

```
Definitely Kanban, because it illustrates my dealings with Vue, MongoDB, Node, Axios, Sockets, UX Design, and working with a partner.

Definitely both Capstones as these are big projects and will deal with many utilities and will display my ability to work with others.

Potentially my Codeworks clicker (moon miner). I'm going to go back and rewrite this utilizing databases and vue components built in the MVCS pattern.

TaskMaster, to show my progression. Bug Log because why not (I'll have to go back and style it up)
