# 3: Bootstrap

## Reflection 

I really enjoyed today's lesson due to it being something I've never used before. It was very easy to grasp; the only annoyance was memorizing all the little class names used for the designing. But I caught on quickly.

I'm still helping out my classmates. I can't believe how easily I understand these things. My brain was wired to think as a programmer, and even though I abandoned programming a long time ago, it appears that the habits are still ingrained into my mind.

Chris said he's waiting for the day he'll ask me something and I'll be completely stumped. I said, without a doubt, that it is most definitely coming. Once we pass Javascript I'm going to be struggling. I look forward to it.

### *"What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?"*
Very general and vague question...
I would say, in general, utilize the web. Utilize libraries such as bootstrap. Automation reduces labor. Reduced labor leads to more time. More time leads to more opportunity.

### *"Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas."*

### *"How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you do to convey through design alone?"*
First impressions are everything. This is a natural law that applies to physical interactions and virtual interactions. Included in these virtual reactions are customer-to-business on the web. 
Because of this, it is extremely important to make sure this first impression is the best we can offer.

Design can convey infinite first impressions: modern, sleek, professional; cute, fun, friendly; angry, frustrated, darkness; loss, sorrow, grief... the list goes on and on. 

To convey a modern feel, one could use sharp or slightly rounded edges, with a few colors mixed in with white about the page. 

To convey sorrow, one could use a lot of dark colors, with emotionally charged images.

These are just some examples. 

Our eyes are one of our primary senses. We utilize communication with this sense through design.
