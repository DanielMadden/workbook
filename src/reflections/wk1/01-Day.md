## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a system designed for version control. (see next question for the significance of this)

GitHub, on the other hand, is a repository for storing the latest version and is also a User Interface to make navigation and tracking of versions easier to understand and read.

## Why do we use Git?
We use git in order to keep track of and control different updates to files. This is important in the cases of bugs and errors. What if you lose the files? 

What if you were working on a file, saved the wrong version, and lost access to the older version? There are many potential mishaps to which Git serves to minimize.

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
My experience with multiple branches is limited. But, from doing some research, I have come to this conclusion:

*Git branches allow us to isolate our work from others.*
    
For example:
One team may be working on the style of the page, another may be working on fixing bugs, and the other may be working on adding new features. These are a lot of tasks, and issues are likely to arise if each team is in the same branch. 

In order to keep the projects isolated, we separate these teams to work in their own branch. When all branches have completed their work, they can agree to merge into the main branch.

This allows for a clean and concise workflow, bringing conflicts to a minimum.
