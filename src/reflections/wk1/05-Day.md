I've really enjoyed this course thus far. My class is great. Everyone's chill. My social needs are fulfilled in here.

In terms of learning, the only new introductions have been Bootstrap and Figma. 

Regardless, I am really grateful that I'm getting a review of HTML and CSS because it's re-solidifying what I once new and forming new connections.

Looking forward to week two.
