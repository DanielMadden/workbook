# 1: Pair Programming

## Prompts

### *What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?*
<br/>

Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation. Typically there is one person actively programming while another watches. The one that is actively programming is actively involved in the task at hand while the watcher is the one who focuses more on the overall direction.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What are some of the benefits of Pair Programming?*
<br/>

I guess a nice benefit of it is that the person watching can catch any errors or small mishaps that the programmer makes.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What are some of the drawbacks to Pair Programming?*
<br/>

The drawbacks of pair programming include inefficiency, incompatibility, miscommunication, boredom, conflict in approaches (which includes wasting time explaining the difference in approaches), and slow progression (especially if the one typing is a slow typer or slow at deciding what to do next).

<br/>

I prefer to "conquer and divide" by splitting branches and keeping live communication about what the partner is doing on their end. This takes trust, which isn't always present between certain groups. Luckily my partner and I trust eachother and we have great communication. This ends up allowing us to accomplish much more at a much faster rate.
