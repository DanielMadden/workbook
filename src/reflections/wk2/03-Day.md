## Prompts 

### *What are the main ways to write information to the console?*
<br/>

```
console.log() 
console.clear()
console.error()
console.assert()
```
<br/><hr/><br/>

### *What tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?*
<br/>

The elements tab! It allows you to select an element on the page and shows you the direct markdown and styling that apply to it.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug our code?*
<br/>

Running the debugger! What's great about the debugger is you can step through EVERY single action that the code performs, and it shows you the value of the items you're passing in.
