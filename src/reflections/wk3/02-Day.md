# 2: Encapsulation

## Prompts
<br/>

### *What is the purpose of Encapsulation?*
<br/>

Encapsulation allows us to restrict access to varialbes. 
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?*
<br/>

Users could modify the variables by using an underscore and screw around with them. 
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *How do we create private variables in an ES6 class?*
<br/>

We make them outside of the class (but still within the script file) and refer to them inside the class. This stops them from being referred in any other script file.
