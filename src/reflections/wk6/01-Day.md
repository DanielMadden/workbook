# Component-Based Architecture

## What is Component-Based Architecture?

"a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems."

## What are some benefits of CBA?

Everything that pertains to a component is defined within that component's class. ALL the HTML, ALL the styling, ALL the logic. It splits these tasks vertically.

## What are some drawbacks of CBA?

It can lead to bloated and polluted views.

Another issue that often happens is that developers over-engineer components, making EVERYTHING a component... which is absolutely unnecessary.
