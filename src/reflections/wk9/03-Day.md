# 3: Scrum for small teams

## Prompts

### *How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?*
<br/>

```
Probably much, much more casual. With less people, communication can become powerfully effective due to the need for less people needing to stay on the same page. This strong communication will reduce the need for having scrums. 
```
<br/><hr/><br/>

### *Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.*
<br/>

```
Because everyone will be on the same page, chasing the same goal. Every sprint must be planned. The scrum is the planning. Things get dangerous when multiple sprints are happening while nobody is on the same page. If multiple sprints were to be utilized, there must be clear communication on every end.
```
<br/><hr/><br/>

### *What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum??*
<br/>

```
The unattainable triangle refers to this paradox: the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. The tradeoffs are that:

- Good service Cheap won't be Fast

- Good service Fast won't be Cheap

- Fast service Cheap won't be Good

Being conscious of these facts allows scrum planning to be more efficient, as time will not be wasted attempting to achieve what is unachieveable.
