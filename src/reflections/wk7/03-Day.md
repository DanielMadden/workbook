# 3: UX Design

## Prompts

### *What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?*
<br/>

The user experience is every interaction a business has with people on its website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services. It's not about what *we* want them to do; it's about what *they* want to do. Our job is to make it easier for them to do that.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?*
<br/>

By keeping our audience's feelings in mind, we can arrange the UX in a way that's pleasing to people. When we make the user feel good, they're more likely to stick around and become customers!
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *Why is the User Experience imporant?*
<br/>

The User Experience is life or death when it comes to making any form of profit or impact off of a product. If the user experience is bad, they will most likely never use the product again. We want the user experience to be good so we can gain and keep our customers.
