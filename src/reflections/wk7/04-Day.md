# 4: Reflection

## Prompts

### *What principles from this weeks reading did you implement?*
<br/>

Well, I was on the front-end and I put a lot of effort into the UX design. Neither of us really knew we had to be doing journals every day (since it was such an odd week compared to what we usually did), so we didn't *exactly* replicate Google's approach, but I think the general idea was implemented: keep things simple and pretty.

We didn't partner program. Didn't want to. It's boring. We tried to split as many tasks as we could, and when he finished most of the stuff on the backend I had him work on sections in the front end that I currently was not involved in.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What went well?*
<br/>

Everything.

The same day that Mark mentioned us choosing our partners was the same day we went straight for each other. We had worked well in the past, and didn't want to experience the hells that we had with other students. Great communication, general competence, consistent trust and reliability, and strong control over emotions and frustration. That's more than I could ask for in a partner.
<br/><br/><hr/><br/>

### *What would you do differently?*
<br/>

Nothing.

In fact, we're both going to continue improving this project to the point where it would be a nice portfolio piece!
