**2.** The `SPA` acronym stands for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
Single Page Application
```
**3.** What are some of the advantages/uses of a `SPA` over a traditional one?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The user never has to travel to another page. Everything that's needed is shown directly on the main page. Don't have to wait for reloads on every travel.
```
**4.** What does the `onMounted` method in Vue do?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
onMounted is a function that runs as soon as the component/page is mounted to the App. The syntax is as follows:

onMounted((params) => {execution})
```
**5.** What is the `v-model` attribute in Vue for, and when might you use it?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

v-model binds data in both directions. This is typically used on inputs and/or text fields to allow for live editing of a variable.
```
**6.** The `v:on` (`@`) directive can be used for what?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the v:on or @ is a shorthand for all of the event listeners built into usual HTML/Javascript, and also adds some custom ones such as @blur
```
**7.** Which Vue attributes(directives) could you use to conditionally render elements on a page?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
v-if: don't even render if the condition is false

v-else-if: if the above fails, test this conditional

v-else: else, render this

v-show: render it, but don't display if the condition is false
```
**8.** What is the purpose of the `key` attribute when using `v-for` on an element?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
the :key is our identifier for that specific sliver of DOM data; it allows for vue to differentiate between all the data generated by the loop.
```
**9.** What is the `<slot>` element and what is it used for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
I never even knew this existed! Seems pretty cool. The <slot> element allows us to receive data from the parent (an alternative to props) and insert into into where the <slot> is located on the template.
