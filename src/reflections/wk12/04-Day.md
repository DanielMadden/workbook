# 4: Final

Today I was going to continue making unnecessary animations and style choices for the flare until Brittany came in and notified us of things we can do to prepare for the upcoming interviews. Due to my priorities, I decided to cut work on the final and get it turned in. Passed all the requirements and the stretch goal tests. I'm satisfied with my current work. My next task is to spin up a landing page and link my apps to it.

Discipline will be key.
