# 4: Pre-Final Reflection


### *Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.*
<br/>

My main concern with the final is successfully linking the JS front-end to the C# back-end. We haven't run through this enough for me to feel confident about it, let alone we got blasted with a lot in the past week. My other concern is the interview preparation and landing a job.

I plan on using Trello to conquer and divide my tasks. Doing daily stand-ups with myself to figure out where I am making progress and what I need to focus on for the day. I will ditch doordashing and code till the end of the day if necessary.

I've enjoyed everything.
