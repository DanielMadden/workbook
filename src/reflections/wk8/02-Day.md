# 2: Scrum for small teams

## Prompts

### *Why is communication on a small team important?*
<br/>

```
It reduces the amount of unnecessary meetings, allowing for more work to be done. It also makes sure nobody is working on something they shouldn't be, and keeps everything clear. Regardless of scrum teams, communication is important in any relationship.
```

### *What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?*
<br/>

```
Understand communication patterns and optimize them; accept the trade-offs, and buy in to the larger goal.
```
<br/><hr/><br/>

### *What is the unnattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?*
<br/>

```
The unattainable triangle refers to this paradox: the set of tradeoffs between the speed of development and the quality of the software delivered. The tradeoffs are that:

- Good service Cheap won't be Fast

- Good service Fast won't be Cheap

- Fast service Cheap won't be Good
```
