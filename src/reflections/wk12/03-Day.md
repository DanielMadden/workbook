# 3: Final

What really frustrates me is the fact that I know I would be two days ahead where I am now if I had just kicked myself to do my work at home. Heck, I would probably be finished by now. Oh well. It is what it is.

Today I focused on styling and even spent large portions of time on creating loading animations that enhance the user experience. Looks very cool and clean.
